

None of the current answers worked for me. I'm using Bootstrap 3.

I liked what Rob Vermeer was doing and started from his response.

For a fade in and then fade out effect, I just used wrote the following function and used jQuery:

Html on my page to add the alert(s) to:

        <div class="alert-messages text-center">
        </div>

Javascript function to show and dismiss the alert.

function showAndDismissAlert(type, message) {
    var htmlAlert = '<div class="alert alert-' + type + '">' + message + '</div>';

    // Prepend so that alert is on top, could also append if we want new alerts to show below instead of on top.
    $(".alert-messages").prepend(htmlAlert);

    // Since we are prepending, take the first alert and tell it to fade in and then fade out.
    // Note: if we were appending, then should use last() instead of first()
    $(".alert-messages .alert").first().hide().fadeIn(200).delay(2000).fadeOut(1000, function () { $(this).remove(); });
}

Then, to show and dismiss the alert, just call the function like this:

    showAndDismissAlert('success', 'Saved Successfully!');
    showAndDismissAlert('danger', 'Error Encountered');
    showAndDismissAlert('info', 'Message Received');

As a side note, I styled the div.alert-messages fixed on top:

    <style>
    div.alert-messages {
        position: fixed;
        top: 50px;
        left: 25%;
        right: 25%;
        z-index: 7000;
    }
    </style>
